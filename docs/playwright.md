# `playwright` config

Config for projects using **Playwright** for testing.

## üèóÔ∏è Setup

1. If you haven't already, make sure to [install `@code-pushup/eslint-config` and its required peer dependencies](../README.md#üèóÔ∏è-setup).
2. Since this plugin requires additional peer dependencies, you have to install them as well:

   ```sh
   npm install -D eslint-plugin-{jest-formatting,playwright}
   ```

3. Add to your `eslint.config.js` file:

   ```js
   import playwright from '@code-pushup/eslint-config/playwright.js';
   import tseslint from 'typescript-eslint';
   
   export default tseslint.config(...playwright);
   ```

## üìè Rules (40)

> üîß Automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).<br>üí° Manually fixable by [editor suggestions](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules#providing-suggestions).
